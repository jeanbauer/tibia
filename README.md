# Tibia Idle Game
> I do not own any rights, this is just a tribute for the greatest game ever

### Want to contribute?

Cool! This little game uses React (16.13) and nothing else. I think it's a pretty simple and minimal code to understand.

Check the open issues to see how you can help: [issues](https://github.com/jeanbauer/tibia/issues).


### How to install and run

Probably you already know how to, but anyway, once you clone this repo:

`yarn add` and `yarn start`

> If you don't have yarn installed you can use npm.


#### This is a tribute
